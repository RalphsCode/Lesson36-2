An app that converts digital time to "spoken time".
For example: 15:46 converts to 'three forty six pm'.

Built a basic HTML interface, and testing via Jest.

RUN: timeWord.html

The js code assumes it is always provided a valid digital time in string format, with two digits for hour, a colon, and 2 digits for minutes.
